1. Introduction
===============

monopd is a dedicated game server daemon for playing Monopoly-like board
games. Clients connect to the server and communicate using short commands
and XML messages.

2. Clients
==========

The monopd design was largely based upon the capability of supporting
multiple games and clients simultaneously. A wide range of clients will make
monopd the de facto board game server/protocol and improves interoperability
between various desktop environments and operating systems.

The following clients are currently available:

Atlantik

More clients are welcome! To get your client included in this list send
e-mail to monopd-devel@lists.capsi.com with a short description of your
client.

3. Requirements
===============

monopd has the following requirements:

- libmuparser >= 2.0.0
  (http://muparser.beltoforion.de/)

- libsystemd-daemon (optional, for systemd notify and socket activation support)

4. Installation
===============

In theory, this should suffice:

./configure && make && su -c "make install"

Arch users might want to run

make -f Makefile.cvs

first.

5. Release notes
================

The best way to stay completely up-to-date with monopd is to use GNU arch.
